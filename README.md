She tries to speak but has lost her voice. Her teacher finds himself drawn to the silent woman, for day by day he is losing his sight.<br /><br />Soon the two discover a deeper pain binds them together. For her, in the space of just a few months, she has lost both her mother and the custody battle for her nine-year-old son. For him, it's the pain of growing up between Korea and Germany, being torn between two cultures and languages, and the fear of losing his independence.<br /><br /><em>Greek Lessons</em>&nbsp;tells the story of two ordinary people brought together at a moment of private anguish&mdash;the fading light of a man losing his vision meeting the silence of a woman who has lost her language. Yet these are the very things that draw them to each other. Slowly the two discover a profound sense of unity&mdash;their voices intersecting with startling beauty, as they move from darkness to light, from silence to breath and expression.<br /><br /><em>Greek Lessons</em>&nbsp;is the story of the unlikely bond between this pair and a tender love letter to human intimacy and connection&mdash;a novel to awaken the senses, one that vividly conjures the essence of what it means to be alive..</p>
